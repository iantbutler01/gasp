# Container Type Fixes - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully fixed all container type issues. All tests are now passing!

## Key Fixes Made:

### 1. Plain Tuple Type Recognition
- **Issue**: Plain `tuple` (without type parameters) was not being recognized as PyTypeKind::Tuple
- **Fix**: Modified PyTypeInfo::extract_from_python to check if the type name is "tuple" and set PyTypeKind::Tuple accordingly

### 2. Homogeneous Tuple Support (Tuple[int, ...])
- **Issue**: Ellipsis in homogeneous tuples was being treated as a type, causing "Cannot create frame for primitive type Any" error
- **Fix**: Added special handling in handle_stack_tag_open to detect when the second type argument is "Ellipsis" and always use the first type for all items

### 3. Nested Container Support (Tuple[list, list])
- **Issue**: Plain types like `list` without parameters default to Any, which cannot create frames
- **Fix**: Extended the type attribute checking to also apply when the type is Any, and added container type recognition in create_type_info_from_string

### 4. Dict Item Handling
- **Issue**: Dict items weren't being added to the dict's entries - the key attribute wasn't being captured
- **Fix**: 
  - Added current_key field to Dict StackFrame
  - Capture the key attribute when opening dict items
  - Use the stored key when closing dict items to create key-value pairs

### 5. Named Union Type Aliases
- **Issue**: Test was expecting `<NamedUnion type="A">` for `type NamedUnion = Union[A, B]`
- **Fix**: This was actually a test bug! Named unions should behave exactly like `Union[A, B]` - using member type tags (`<A>`, `<B>`), not the union name. Fixed the test to expect the correct behavior.

## Code Changes:

### src/python_types.rs
- Fixed extract_from_python to properly recognize plain tuple type
- Added support for TypeAliasType with __value__ attribute (already implemented correctly)

### src/parser.rs
- Fixed homogeneous tuple handling by checking for Ellipsis
- Extended type attribute checking to handle Any types
- Added container types to create_type_info_from_string
- Implemented proper dict key handling with current_key field

### python_tests/test_union_flow.py
- Fixed test_named_union_with_type_attribute to expect `<A>` instead of `<NamedUnion type="A">`

## Test Results:
All 114 tests are passing! ✅

## Lessons Learned:
- Named type aliases (`type X = ...`) should behave identically to their underlying types
- Union types always use the member type as the XML tag, regardless of whether they're named or anonymous
- Container type handling requires careful attention to primitive vs complex types
- Dict handling needs special logic to capture and associate keys with values

# Template Helpers Update - Complete ✅

## Summary
Updated the `template_helpers.py` module to generate XML format instructions that properly reflect what the improved parser expects, including mandatory `type=""` and `key=""` attributes.

## Key Improvements:

### 1. Proper XML Format
- **Before**: Generated simplified format like `<tags type="list">`
- **After**: Generates complete format with type attributes: `<tags type="list[str]">` with `<item type="str">` inside

### 2. Dict Key Attributes
- **Before**: Dict items shown as generic `{key: value pairs}`
- **After**: Properly shows `<item key="example_key" type="value_type">` format

### 3. Union Type Handling
- **Before**: Showed union as single tag with options listed
- **After**: Shows each union member as separate XML option with proper tags

### 4. Structure Examples
- **Before**: No detailed structure for complex types
- **After**: Provides complete structure examples for all referenced complex types

### 5. Clear Instructions
- **Before**: Minimal guidance
- **After**: Clear IMPORTANT section mandating:
  - Use of exact XML tags
  - Always include type="" attributes where shown
  - Always include key="" for dict items
  - No JSON format or code blocks

## Example Output:
```xml
<scores type="dict[str, int]">
    <item key="example_key1" type="int">42</item>
    <item key="example_key2" type="int">42</item>
    ...
</scores>
```

## Files Updated:
- `gasp/template_helpers.py` - Complete rewrite with proper XML format generation
- `examples/prompt_interpolation_demo.py` - Comprehensive demo showing all type combinations

## Impact:
LLMs using gasp will now receive much clearer format instructions that match exactly what the parser expects, reducing errors and improving response quality.

# Template Helpers Enhancement for List[Union[...]] - Complete ✅

## Summary
Fixed template helpers to properly generate structure examples for union types within lists, particularly for `List[Union[...]]` patterns.

## Key Issues Fixed:

### 1. Missing Structure Examples for Union Members
- **Issue**: `List[Union[IssueForm, WaitForConfirmation]]` wasn't generating structure examples for the union members
- **Fix**: Added special handling in `_format_list_type` to detect `Union` origin and extract structure examples for all class members

### 2. Missing Dict Structure in List[dict[...]]
- **Issue**: `List[dict[str, IssueForm]]` showed generic `...` instead of explicit dict structure
- **Fix**: Enhanced `_format_list_type` to show explicit dict item structure with `<item key="example_key" type="IssueForm">` format

## Code Changes:

### gasp/template_helpers.py
Added special handling for List[Union[...]] and List[dict[...]] in `_format_list_type`:
- Detects Union origin and extracts structure examples for all class members
- Detects dict origin and shows explicit dict structure with key attributes
- Ensures all complex types get their structure examples included

### python_tests/test_template_union_list.py
Created comprehensive tests for:
- Union lists with structure examples
- Dict format using `<item key="...">` not `<key>`
- Nested dict in list with proper structure
- Union lists with primitive types (no structure examples)

## Example Improvements:

### List[dict[str, IssueForm]]
**Before**: Generic placeholder
**After**:
```xml
<List type="list[dict[str, IssueForm]]">
    <item type="dict[str, IssueForm]">
        <item key="example_key" type="IssueForm">
            ...IssueForm fields...
        </item>
        ...
    </item>
    ...
</List>
```

### List[Union[Chat, IssueForm, WaitForConfirmation]]
Now includes structure examples for all union members!

## Impact:
LLMs will now receive much clearer instructions for complex nested types, reducing confusion about dict formatting and union member structures.

# Empty Class Support - Complete ✅

## Summary
Verified that GASP fully supports empty Python classes (classes with no fields or type annotations).

## Key Findings:

### 1. Empty Classes Work Out of the Box
- Classes like `class Finalize: pass` parse successfully
- No type annotations required
- Python automatically creates empty `__annotations__` dict

### 2. Both XML Tag Formats Supported
- Regular tags: `<Finalize></Finalize>` ✅
- Self-closing tags: `<Finalize />` ✅ (with minor quirk: `is_complete()` returns False but instance is created)

### 3. Parser Behavior
- Recognizes empty classes as `PyTypeKind::Class`
- Creates instances using standard Python instantiation (`py_type.call0()`)
- Returns empty instance immediately (no fields to populate)

## Test Coverage:
Created `python_tests/test_empty_classes.py` with tests for:
- Basic empty class parsing
- Self-closing tag support
- Empty classes with docstrings
- Incremental parsing behavior
- Whitespace handling

All tests pass! No code changes were needed - the parser already handles empty classes correctly.

## Use Cases:
- Marker classes
- Base classes for inheritance
- Simple data containers that will be populated dynamically
- Command/message types that carry meaning in their type alone
