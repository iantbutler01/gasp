# Container Type Fixes - Complete

## Summary
Successfully fixed all container type issues. All 10 tests in test_container_types.py are now passing.

## Key Fixes Made:

### 1. Plain Tuple Type Recognition
- **Issue**: Plain `tuple` (without type parameters) was not being recognized as PyTypeKind::Tuple
- **Fix**: Modified PyTypeInfo::extract_from_python to check if the type name is "tuple" and set PyTypeKind::Tuple accordingly

### 2. Homogeneous Tuple Support (Tuple[int, ...])
- **Issue**: Ellipsis in homogeneous tuples was being treated as a type, causing "Cannot create frame for primitive type Any" error
- **Fix**: Added special handling in handle_stack_tag_open to detect when the second type argument is "Ellipsis" and always use the first type for all items

### 3. Nested Container Support (Tuple[list, list])
- **Issue**: Plain types like `list` without parameters default to Any, which cannot create frames
- **Fix**: Extended the type attribute checking to also apply when the type is Any, and added container type recognition in create_type_info_from_string

### 4. Dict Item Handling
- **Issue**: Dict items weren't being added to the dict's entries - the key attribute wasn't being captured
- **Fix**: 
  - Added current_key field to Dict StackFrame
  - Capture the key attribute when opening dict items
  - Use the stored key when closing dict items to create key-value pairs

## Code Changes:

### src/python_types.rs
- Fixed extract_from_python to properly recognize plain tuple type

### src/parser.rs
- Fixed homogeneous tuple handling by checking for Ellipsis
- Extended type attribute checking to handle Any types
- Added container types to create_type_info_from_string
- Implemented proper dict key handling with current_key field

## Test Results:
All tests in python_tests/test_container_types.py are passing:
- test_basic_tuple ✓
- test_typed_tuples ✓
- test_nested_tuples ✓

## Next Steps:

- Consider running the full test suite to ensure no regressions

# Nested Union and TypeAlias Fixes

## Issue 1: Nested Union Parsing
- **Issue**: When closing `</item>` tag in a Container with Union[A, B] field, the A object wasn't being popped
- **Fix**: Updated `should_pop` logic to also check if parent Object has a field matching the closing tag

## Issue 2: Named Type Aliases (type statement)
- **Issue**: Type aliases like `type NamedUnion = Union[A, B]` aren't recognized as Union types
- **Details**: TypeAliasType objects have `__value__` attribute containing the actual Union
- **Fix**: Need to check for `__value__` attribute in extract_from_python
