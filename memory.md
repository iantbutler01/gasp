# Memory File: Stack-Based Parser Refactor

## Current State

Significant progress has been made on the stack-based parser refactor. The following key issues have been resolved:

1. **Tag Filtering**: Fixed the `TagFinder` to properly emit nested tags as tag events instead of raw bytes, allowing the parser to correctly handle object fields.
2. **Union Type Handling**: Enhanced the parser to use the `type` attribute on tags to determine which union member to instantiate for lists, sets, and object fields.
3. **List Item Parsing**: Fixed the issue where only the first item in a list was being returned by properly handling `</item>` closing tags for objects inside containers.
4. **Streaming Scalar Types**: Fixed incremental parsing for primitive types (str, int, float, bool) to return partial results as content is streamed.

## Test Results

### Priority Test Files Status:
1. **`test_tag_filtering.py`**: ✅ All 8 tests passing
2. **`test_type_support_summary.py`**: ✅ All 6 tests passing  
3. **`test_incremental_coercion.py`**: 4/5 tests passing
   - The only failure is due to HTML entity encoding (`&amp;` vs `&`)
4. **`test_scalar_parsing.py`**: ✅ All 9 tests passing (including streaming)

## Key Changes Made

### tag_finder.rs
- Modified to emit nested tags inside wanted tags as proper `TagEvent::Open` and `TagEvent::Close` events
- This ensures the parser can see and handle object fields correctly

### parser.rs
- Enhanced `handle_stack_tag_open` to check the `type` attribute when dealing with Union types
- Fixed `handle_stack_tag_close` to handle `</item>` tags that close objects inside containers
- Properly extracts the actual type from unions based on the `type` attribute
- Fixed primitive type handling to return incremental results during streaming:
  - Added partial result building for primitive types
  - Ensured the parser returns accumulated content as it's received
  - This enables true streaming functionality where results are available before the closing tag

## Remaining Issues

1. **HTML Entity Decoding**: The parser already decodes HTML entities for strings in `frame_to_pyobject`, but there may be edge cases.
2. **Compiler Warnings**: Various unused variables and functions that should be cleaned up once the refactor is complete.

## Next Steps

1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Now that the priority tests and scalar parsing are passing, run the full test suite to identify any remaining issues.
2. **Fix Edge Cases**: Address any remaining test failures in the full test suite.
3. **Code Cleanup**: Remove unused functions and fix compiler warnings.
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure the new stack-based parser performs well with large inputs.

The parser refactor is now largely functional for the core use cases involving lists, unions, nested objects, and streaming primitives. The incremental parsing capability - the core value of this parser - is working correctly.
