# GASP (Gee Another Schema Parser)

GASP is a high-performance Rust-based parser and validator for WAIL (Widely Applicable Interface Language) schemas and JSON responses. It's specifically designed to work with Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing robust error recovery for common LLM response quirks.

## What is WAIL?

WAIL (Widely Applicable Interface Language) is a schema language designed for:
1. Generating type-validated LLM prompts
2. Validating JSON responses from LLMs
3. Providing clear error messages for schema violations

## Features

- **Robust Error Recovery**: Handles common LLM response issues like trailing commas, unquoted identifiers, and malformed JSON
- **Type Validation**: Strong type checking for both schema definitions and JSON responses
- **High Performance**: Written in Rust with Python bindings for optimal speed
- **Developer Friendly**: Clear error messages and intuitive schema syntax
- **LLM-Optimized**: Specifically designed to work with the quirks and inconsistencies of LLM outputs

## Installation

```bash
pip install gasp-py
```

## Usage

```python
from gasp_py import WAILGenerator

# Create a validator with your WAIL schema
generator = WAILGenerator(r'''
    # Define your schema here
    object Response {
        name: String,
        age: Number,
        interests: Array<String>
    }

    # Define your template function
    template GenerateResponse(desc: String) -> Response {
        prompt """
        Based on {{desc}} generate a response that returns {{return_type}}      
        """
    }

    # Define your main block which can handle variable assignments
    main {
        let template = Response(desc: "A really responsy response")

        prompt {
            We're showing off examples and example of of a prompt generated by WAIL looks like this:

            {{template}}
        }
    }
''')

# Get the prompt to send to the LLM
(prompt, warnings, errors) = generator.get_prompt()

# Parse and validate JSON responses
generator.parse_llm_output("""
{
    name: "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "interests": [coding, 'AI', "music"]
}
""")

# Note the ability to handle malformed JSON
```

## Error Recovery

GASP includes built-in error recovery for common LLM response issues:
- Trailing commas in arrays and objects
- Unquoted identifiers in object keys
- Missing quotes around strings
- Inconsistent whitespace and formatting

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example showing how to use GASP in Python:

```python
from gasp import WAILGenerator
import json

def create_person_prompt():
    """Define the WAIL schema for person generation."""
    return r'''
    # Define our Person type
    object Person {
        name: String
        age: Number
        interests: String[]
    }

    # Define a template for generating a person from a description
    template GetPersonFromDescription(description: String) -> Person {
        prompt: """
        Given this description of a person: "{{description}}"

        Create a Person object with their name, age, and interests.
        Return in this format: 
        {{return_type}}
        """
    }

    main {
        # This is a comment
        let person_prompt = GetPersonFromDescription(
            description: "Alice is a 25-year-old software engineer who loves coding, AI, and hiking."
        );

        # This is the prompt we'll send to the LLM
        prompt {
            This is an example of a prompt generated by WAIL:
            {{person_prompt}}
        }
    }
    '''

def main():
    # Initialize our validator with the schema
    generator = WAILGenerator()
    generator.load_wail(create_person_prompt())

    warnings, errors = generator.validate_wail()

    print("Validation Results:")
    print("\nWarnings:")
    print(warnings)
    print("\nErrors:")
    print(errors)

    # Get the generated prompt - this is what you'd send to your LLM
    (prompt, warnings, errors) = generator.get_prompt()
    print("Generated Prompt:")
    print(prompt)
    print("Warnings:")
    print(warnings)
    print("Errors:")
    print(errors)

    # In a real application, you would send this prompt to your LLM
    # Here we'll simulate an LLM response with some typical quirks
    llm_response = """
    {
        'name': 'Alice',
        'age': 25,
        'interests': [
            "coding",
            'AI',
            hiking,
        ]
    }
    """

    try:
        # Validate the LLM's response and get the parsed JSON as a Python dict
        result = generator.parse_llm_output(llm_response)
        print("✓ Response validation successful!")

        result = result["person_prompt"]
        

        # Work with the validated data
        print("\nParsed Person:")
        print(f"Name: {result['name']}")
        print(f"Age: {result['age']}")
        print(f"Interests: {', '.join(result['interests'])}")
        
        # # You can also convert it to standard JSON
        # print("\nAs standard JSON:")
        # print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Validation error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main() 
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Creating a WAIL schema with proper Python string formatting
2. Defining object types and templates in WAIL
3. Generating a type-aware prompt for your LLM
4. Handling common LLM response quirks automatically
5. Validating and parsing the response
6. Working with the validated data in Python

When run, this script will output:
```
Validation Results:
Warnings:
[]
Errors:
[]
Generated Prompt:

This is an example of a prompt generated by WAIL:

Given this description of a person: "Alice is a 25-year-old software engineer who loves coding, AI, and hiking."

Create a Person object with their name, age, and interests.
Return in this format: 

{
  name: string
  age: number
  interests: String[]>
}


Warnings:
[]
Errors:
[]
✓ Response validation successful!

Parsed Person:
Name: Alice
Age: 25
Interests: coding, AI, hiking
```
