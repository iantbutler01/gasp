# Stack-Based Parser Refactor Status

## Summary
The stack-based parser refactor has made significant progress, with the core streaming functionality now working correctly. The parser can handle incremental parsing of primitives, lists, objects, and unions with proper partial result returns.

## Test Results Overview
- **Total Tests**: 121
- **Passing**: 102 (84%)
- **Failing**: 19 (16%)

## Fully Working Features ✅

### 1. Primitive Types
- String, int, float, bool parsing
- Incremental/streaming support for all primitives
- HTML entity decoding for strings

### 2. Lists
- Basic list parsing
- Lists of primitives
- Lists of objects
- Lists with union types
- Nested lists
- Incremental list parsing with partial results

### 3. Classes/Objects
- Basic object parsing
- Nested objects
- Objects with union fields
- Partial object construction via `__gasp_from_partial__`
- Field-by-field incremental updates

### 4. Union Types
- Union discrimination via `type` attribute
- Union discrimination via tag name
- Unions in lists
- Unions as object fields
- Basic union streaming

### 5. Tag Filtering
- Ignored tags (think, thinking, system, thought)
- Custom ignored tags
- Nested tag handling within wanted tags

## Not Yet Implemented ❌

### 1. Dict Support
- Dict parsing not implemented
- Need to handle `<entry>` tags with key/value pairs

### 2. Set Support  
- Set parsing not implemented
- Similar to list but needs deduplication

### 3. Tuple Support
- Tuple parsing not implemented
- Need to handle fixed-length sequences with type checking

### 4. Optional/None Handling
- Some edge cases with None values not handled
- Optional nested types need work

### 5. Advanced Union Cases
- Nested unions (union within union)
- Some edge cases with union type inference

## Key Implementation Details

### Stack Frame Types
The parser uses different stack frames for different data structures:
- `Field`: For primitive values being accumulated
- `List`: For list containers with items
- `Object`: For class instances with fields
- `Dict`: Placeholder for dict implementation
- `Set`: Placeholder for set implementation
- `Tuple`: Placeholder for tuple implementation

### Incremental Parsing Flow
1. Tag events are emitted by TagFinder
2. Parser processes events and updates stack
3. For each chunk, parser returns partial results
4. Complete results returned when closing tag processed

### Union Type Resolution
- Checks `type` attribute first
- Falls back to tag name matching
- Properly handles unions in lists and as object fields

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Dict Support**
   - Handle `<dict>` and `<entry>` tags
   - Parse key/value pairs
   - Support incremental dict building

2. **Implement Set Support**
   - Similar to list but with deduplication
   - Handle `<set>` and `<item>` tags

3. **Implement Tuple Support**
   - Fixed-length sequences
   - Type checking for each position
   - Handle `<tuple>` and `<item>` tags

4. **Fix Optional/None Handling**
   - Proper None value support
   - Optional field handling in classes

5. **Clean Up Code**
   - Remove unused functions
   - Fix compiler warnings
   - Remove old XML-based parser code

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the parser
   - Optimize hot paths
   - Reduce allocations

## Conclusion

The stack-based parser refactor has successfully implemented the core functionality needed for incremental XML parsing with Python type support. The streaming capability - the key value proposition of this parser - is working correctly for the most common use cases. The remaining work is primarily adding support for additional container types and fixing edge cases.
